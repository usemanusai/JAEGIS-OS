# Enhanced Story Draft Checklist with Intelligence

## Purpose

- Comprehensive story draft validation with real-time validation and research integration
- Conduct draft validation with validated agile methodologies and collaborative intelligence
- Ensure draft excellence with current agile development standards and story practices
- Integrate web research for current story frameworks and draft patterns
- Provide validated draft assessments with cross-team coordination and continuous optimization

## Enhanced Capabilities

### Draft Intelligence
- **Draft Validation**: Real-time story draft validation against current agile development standards
- **Research Integration**: Current agile story best practices and draft frameworks
- **Story Assessment**: Comprehensive story draft analysis and quality optimization
- **Requirements Validation**: Story requirements analysis and draft validation with continuous improvement

### Collaborative Intelligence
- **Shared Context Integration**: Access to all story contexts and draft requirements
- **Cross-Team Coordination**: Seamless collaboration with development teams and agile stakeholders
- **Quality Assurance**: Professional-grade story draft validation with validation reports
- **Research Integration**: Current agile development, story drafting, and requirements best practices

[[LLM: VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - All story draft validations must be validated for clarity, completeness, and current agile standards. Include research-backed story methodologies and drafting principles.]]

The enhanced Scrum Master should use this checklist with validation intelligence to validate that each story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out using research-backed methodologies.

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

## VALIDATION RESULT

| Category                             | Status            | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL |        |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL |        |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL |        |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL |        |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL |        |

**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation
- NEEDS REVISION: The story requires updates (see issues)
- BLOCKED: External information required (specify what information)
