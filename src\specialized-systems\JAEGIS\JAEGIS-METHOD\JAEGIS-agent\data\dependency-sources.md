## Context7 Integration Patterns

### üî¨ **Automated Research Queries**
```yaml
Security Research:
  query_template: "security vulnerabilities {package_name} {version} {current_date}"
  sources: ["nvd", "github_advisories", "snyk", "osv"]
  frequency: "Real-time for critical, daily for others"
  
Update Research:
  query_template: "breaking changes migration guide {package_name} {old_version} to {new_version}"
  sources: ["official_docs", "github_releases", "community_discussions"]
  frequency: "On-demand during updates"
  
Alternative Research:
  query_template: "modern alternatives to {deprecated_package} 2025"
  sources: ["community_recommendations", "benchmark_comparisons", "adoption_trends"]
  frequency: "Weekly for deprecated packages"
```

### üìä **Data Quality Validation**
```yaml
Source Reliability Scoring:
  primary_sources: 10  # Official registries, NVD
  verified_sources: 8  # GitHub, Snyk, Libraries.io
  community_sources: 6  # Reddit, Stack Overflow
  unverified_sources: 3  # Individual blogs, forums
  
Freshness Requirements:
  security_data: "< 1 hour"
  version_data: "< 6 hours"
  trend_data: "< 24 hours"
  historical_data: "< 7 days"
```

## Data Source Monitoring

### üîç **Source Health Monitoring**
```yaml
Availability Monitoring:
  check_frequency: "Every 5 minutes"
  timeout_threshold: "30 seconds"
  retry_attempts: 3
  fallback_sources: "Configured per source type"
  
Rate Limit Monitoring:
  tracking: "Requests per minute/hour"
  alerting: "80% of limit reached"
  backoff_strategy: "Exponential with jitter"
  
Data Quality Monitoring:
  schema_validation: "Continuous"
  freshness_checks: "Hourly"
  consistency_validation: "Cross-source comparison"
```

### üìà **Usage Analytics**
```yaml
Source Utilization:
  most_used_sources: "Track for optimization"
  response_times: "Monitor for performance"
  success_rates: "Track for reliability"
  cost_analysis: "For paid sources"
  
Context7 Integration Metrics:
  research_quality_score: "User feedback based"
  source_contribution: "Per research query"
  accuracy_validation: "Community verification"
```

This comprehensive data source catalog ensures Dakota has access to the most reliable, current, and comprehensive dependency intelligence while maintaining optimal Context7 integration for automated research and validation.
