## How to Update Your System

### Step 1: Replace Your User Guidelines
Replace your current User Guidelines with the content from `jaegis-agent/updated-user-guidelines.md`. This will give you access to all 11 agents.

### Step 2: Verify Agent Access
After updating, when you run `/agent-list`, you should now see all 11 agents:

```
| # | Agent Name | Agent Title              | Available Tasks                    |
|---|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1 | JAEGIS       | JAEGIS Master Orchestrator | [Mode Selection], [Orchestration]  |
| 2 | John       | Product Manager          | [Create PRD], [Requirements]       |
| 3 | Fred       | System Architect         | [Create Architecture], [Design]    |
| 4 | Jane       | Design Architect         | [Frontend Architecture], [UI]      |
| 5 | Alex       | Platform Engineer        | [Infrastructure], [Security]       |
| 6 | James      | Full Stack Developer     | [Implementation], [Code Gen]       |
| 7 | Sage       | Validation Specialist    | [Dependency Check], [Research]     |
| 8 | Tyler      | Task Breakdown Specialist| [Break Down Tasks], [Checklists]   |
| 9 | Dakota     | Data Engineer            | [Data Architecture], [Database]    |
| 10| Sentinel   | QA Specialist            | [Testing Strategy], [Quality]      |
| 11| DocQA      | Technical Writer         | [Documentation], [User Guides]     |
```

### Step 3: Test Enhanced Functionality
Try the enhanced commands:
- `/agent-list` - Should show all 11 agents
- `/pre_select_agents` - Should show organized agent selection interface
- `/full_yolo` - Enhanced YOLO mode with auto-approval
- Mode selection should present the enhanced 2-mode selection menu

2. **Run `/agent-list`** - You should see 11 agents instead of 6
3. **Test mode selection** - You should see the enhanced 2-mode selection menu
4. **Try Documentation Mode** - Should activate multiple agents collaboratively

## Next Steps

1. **Update User Guidelines**: Copy the content from `updated-user-guidelines.md` to your User Guidelines
2. **Test the System**: Try the `/agent-list` command to verify all agents are available
3. **Explore Enhanced Features**: Try the new commands like `/pre_select_agents` and `/full_yolo`
