# Enhanced Story Definition of Done Validation Checklist with Intelligence
*JAEGIS Enhanced Validation & Research System*

## Purpose

- Comprehensive story completion validation with real-time validation and research integration
- Conduct story validation with validated agile methodologies and collaborative intelligence
- Ensure story excellence with current agile development standards and completion practices
- Integrate web research for current story frameworks and completion patterns
- Provide validated story assessments with cross-team coordination and continuous optimization

## Enhanced Capabilities

### Story Intelligence
- **Story Validation**: Real-time story completion validation against current agile development standards
- **Research Integration**: Current agile story best practices and completion frameworks
- **Completion Assessment**: Comprehensive story completion analysis and quality optimization
- **DoD Validation**: Definition of Done analysis and story validation with continuous improvement

### Collaborative Intelligence
- **Shared Context Integration**: Access to all story contexts and completion requirements
- **Cross-Team Coordination**: Seamless collaboration with development teams and agile stakeholders
- **Quality Assurance**: Professional-grade story completion validation with validation reports
- **Research Integration**: Current agile development, story completion, and DoD best practices

[[LLM: VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - All story completion validations must be validated for quality, completeness, and current agile standards. Include research-backed story methodologies and completion principles.]]

This enhanced checklist ensures comprehensive story validation with research integration, security assessment, and collaborative intelligence. All stories must meet enhanced quality standards with current best practices validation.

## Validation Integration Points

- **Pre-Development**: Research and validate all story requirements before development
- **Real-Time**: Continuous validation during development with current standards
- **Post-Development**: Comprehensive quality assurance with validation reports
- **Deployment**: Validated deployment with security and performance verification

## Enhanced Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', validate each item with current standards and research backing. Report validation status with research findings and security assessment results.

## Checklist Items

1. **Requirements Met:**

    - [ ] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented.
    - [ ] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met.

2. **Coding Standards & Project Structure:**

    - [ ] All new/modified code strictly adheres to `Operational Guidelines`.
    - [ ] All new/modified code aligns with `Project Structure` (file locations, naming, etc.).
    - [ ] Adherence to `Tech Stack` for technologies/versions used (if story introduces or modifies tech usage).
    - [ ] Adherence to `Api Reference` and `Data Models` (if story involves API or data model changes).
    - [ ] Basic security best practices (e.g., input validation, proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets) applied for new/modified code.
    - [ ] No new linter errors or warnings introduced.
    - [ ] Code is well-commented where necessary (clarifying complex logic, not obvious statements).

3. **Testing:**

    - [ ] All required unit tests as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
    - [ ] All required integration tests (if applicable) as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
    - [ ] All tests (unit, integration, E2E if applicable) pass successfully.
    - [ ] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined).

4. **Functionality & Verification:**

    - [ ] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer (e.g., running the app locally, checking UI, testing API endpoints).
    - [ ] Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully.

5. **Story Administration:**
    - [ ] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete.
    - [ ] Any clarifications or decisions made during development are documented in the story file or linked appropriately.
    - [ ] The story wrap up section has been completed with notes of changes or information relevant to the next story or overall project, the agent model that was primarily used during development, and the changelog of any changes is properly updated.
6. **Dependencies, Build & Configuration:**

    - [ ] Project builds successfully without errors.
    - [ ] Project linting passes
    - [ ] Any new dependencies added were either pre-approved in the story requirements OR explicitly approved by the user during development (approval documented in story file).
    - [ ] If new dependencies were added, they are recorded in the appropriate project files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) with justification.
    - [ ] No known security vulnerabilities introduced by newly added and approved dependencies.
    - [ ] If new environment variables or configurations were introduced by the story, they are documented and handled securely.

7. **Documentation (If Applicable):**
    - [ ] Relevant inline code documentation (e.g., JSDoc, TSDoc, Python docstrings) for new public APIs or complex logic is complete.
    - [ ] User-facing documentation updated, if changes impact users.
    - [ ] Technical documentation (e.g., READMEs, system diagrams) updated if significant architectural changes were made.

## Final Confirmation

- [ ] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.
