## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Commands Don't Work**
1. Try `/help` first - it always works
2. Check spelling and format
3. Use `/status` to check system health
4. Try `/exit` and restart

### **If Agents Don't Respond**
1. Use `/agent-list` to verify agent availability
2. Try `/load-{agent}` instead of `/{agent}`
3. Use `/jaegis` to return to orchestrator
4. Check with `/status`

### **If Help Doesn't Appear**
This shouldn't happen - the help system has universal recognition and works with:
- `/help`, `help`, "what commands", "show commands", etc.
- If it fails, the system needs technical attention
