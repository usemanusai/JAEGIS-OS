# Enhanced Container Registries with Validation Intelligence
*JAEGIS Enhanced Validation System*

## Overview

This document contains enhanced container registry information with validation requirements, research integration, and collaborative intelligence for container deployment within the JAEGIS ecosystem. All registries are validated for security and current best practices.

## Enhanced Registry Framework

### Validation-Driven Container Registries
- **Registry Validation**: All container registries must be validated for security compliance and current containerization standards
- **Research Integration**: Registry choices must be supported by current container security research and deployment best practices
- **Security Assessment**: Comprehensive security validation integrated into all container registry configurations
- **Performance Validation**: Container registry performance optimization and deployment efficiency validation

### Collaborative Intelligence Standards
- **Shared Context Integration**: All container registries must support project context and deployment coordination
- **Cross-Team Validation**: Registry configurations validated for consistency across all deployment teams
- **Quality Assurance**: Professional-grade container registry documentation with validation reports
- **Research Integration**: Current containerization methodologies and deployment best practices
