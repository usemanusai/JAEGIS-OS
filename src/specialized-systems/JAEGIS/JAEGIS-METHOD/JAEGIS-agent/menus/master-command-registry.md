### **Natural Language Recognition Patterns**
```yaml
recognition_patterns:

    natural_language:
      - "how do the commands work"
      - "what commands are available"
      - "show me all commands"
      - "list all commands"
      - "help me with commands"
      - "what can I do"
      - "available commands"
      - "command list"
      - "show commands"
      - "help menu"
    partial_matches: ["command", "commands", "help", "menu", "options"]
    
  agent_requests:
    patterns:
      - "switch to {agent}"
      - "activate {agent}"
      - "load {agent}"
      - "talk to {agent}"
      - "use {agent}"
    
  workflow_requests:
    patterns:
      - "start team mode"
      - "enable all agents"
      - "group collaboration"
      - "automatic mode"
```

This master command registry ensures that only functional, tested commands appear in the help system, maintaining accuracy and reliability across all sessions.
