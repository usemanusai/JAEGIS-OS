# Enhanced Technical Preferences with Validation Standards
*JAEGIS Enhanced Validation System*

## Overview

This document defines enhanced technical preferences with validation requirements, research integration, and collaborative intelligence standards for JAEGIS projects. All preferences are backed by current research and validated for security and compatibility.

## Enhanced Validation Requirements

### Technology Selection Criteria
- **Current Version Validation**: All technologies must use current, stable versions with security validation
- **Security Assessment**: Comprehensive security evaluation with vulnerability scanning
- **Research Backing**: Technology choices must be supported by current industry research and best practices
- **Compatibility Validation**: Cross-platform and framework compatibility verification

### Collaborative Intelligence Standards
- **Shared Context Integration**: All technical decisions must integrate with project context
- **Cross-Agent Validation**: Technology choices validated across all agent perspectives
- **Quality Assurance**: Professional-grade technical standards with validation reports
- **Research Integration**: Current best practices and emerging technology trends

## User-Defined Preferences (Enhanced with Validation)

List your preferred technologies with validation requirements:
- **Technical Preferences**: (All must be validated for current versions and security)
- **Design Patterns**: (Must be backed by current best practices research)
- **Languages**: (Must include security and performance validation)
- **Frameworks**: (Must be validated for compatibility and current standards)
- **Development Tools**: (Must be validated for security and integration capabilities)

Anything you learn or prefer over time to drive future project choices, add them here.

These will be used by the agents when producing PRD and Architectures
