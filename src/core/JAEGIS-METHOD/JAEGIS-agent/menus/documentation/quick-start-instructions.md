## ðŸš€ **3-STEP QUICK START**

### **Step 1: Get Help (Works Every Time)**
```bash
# Any of these work instantly:
/help
help
"what commands are available?"
"show me all commands"
```
**Result:** Complete command list with all available features

### **Step 2: See All Agents**
```bash
/agent-list
```
**Result:** Table of all 24+ specialized AI agents and their capabilities

### **Step 3: Start Working**
```bash
# Choose any agent:
/architect    # System design and architecture
/dev         # Full-stack development
/pm          # Project management
/po          # Product ownership

# Or describe your project in natural language:
"I want to build a web application"
"Help me design a system architecture"
"Create a project plan for my team"
```
**Result:** Immediate agent activation and project assistance
