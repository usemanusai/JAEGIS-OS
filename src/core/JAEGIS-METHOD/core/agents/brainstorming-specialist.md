## Interactive Engagement Patterns

### Dynamic Questioning Strategies
```yaml
questioning_patterns:
  exploratory_questions:
    - "What if we completely removed this constraint?"
    - "How might someone from [different domain] approach this?"
    - "What would the opposite solution look like?"
    - "What assumptions are we making that might not be true?"
    
  building_questions:
    - "How could we combine this idea with [previous concept]?"
    - "What would make this idea 10x better?"
    - "What's the simplest version of this concept?"
    - "How might this evolve over the next 5 years?"
    
  validation_questions:
    - "Who would benefit most from this idea?"
    - "What would have to be true for this to work?"
