### Step 5: Start PRD Creation

```
Prompt: Let's create a comprehensive PRD for TeamTask Pro based on our brainstorming insights.
```

**AI Response**:
```
üìã Perfect! I'll create a comprehensive PRD using our interactive template.

[Calls jaegis_create_prd action with template_type: "comprehensive"]

‚úÖ PRD creation started! Let's begin with the Executive Summary.

**Section 1: Executive Summary**

Based on our brainstorming, here's what I understand:

**Problem Statement**: Small teams (3-15 people) struggle with task management tools that are either too simple (lacking collaboration features) or too complex (requiring extensive setup and training).

**Solution Overview**: TeamTask Pro combines effortless simplicity with powerful collaboration features, providing real-time team coordination, intelligent automation, and seamless integration with existing workflows.

**Target Market**: Small to medium businesses, startups, creative agencies, and remote teams who need enterprise-level coordination without enterprise-level complexity.

Let's refine this executive summary. What's the most important problem we're solving?
```

### Step 6: Refine Executive Summary

**Your Response**:
```
The most important problem is that small teams waste time on task management overhead instead of actual work. They either use tools that don't scale with their growth or enterprise tools that slow them down with unnecessary complexity.
```

**AI Response**:
```
üéØ Perfect! That's a much sharper problem statement. Let me update the executive summary:

**Executive Summary - Refined**

**Problem**: Small teams waste 20-30% of their productive time on task management overhead - either struggling with tools that don't scale or being slowed down by enterprise solutions designed for large organizations.

**Solution**: TeamTask Pro eliminates task management overhead through intelligent automation, real-time collaboration, and effortless simplicity. Teams can focus on work, not workflow management.

**Market Opportunity**: 50M+ small teams globally spend $2B+ annually on productivity tools that don't fit their needs.
