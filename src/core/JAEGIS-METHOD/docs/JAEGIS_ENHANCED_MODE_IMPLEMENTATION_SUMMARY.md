# JAEGIS AI Agent Orchestrator Enhanced Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully enhanced the existing JAEGIS AI Agent Orchestrator system by expanding the mandatory Mode Selection Menu from 2 options to 8 comprehensive options. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding powerful new workflow modes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Agent Prompt (web-build-sample/agent-prompt.txt)

**Key Changes:**
- **Mandatory Mode Selection Menu**: Added comprehensive 8-mode selection that users MUST choose before proceeding
- **Mode-Based Workflow Execution**: Updated operational workflow to handle each mode with specific AI agent activation patterns
- **Enhanced Commands**: Added `/full_yolo` and `/pre_select_agents` commands with detailed implementation
- **AI Agent Terminology**: Updated all references to use "AI Agent" terminology consistently

**New Operational Workflow Structure:**
1. **Greeting & Mandatory Mode Selection** - Forces mode selection before any other actions
2. **Mode-Based Workflow Execution** - Handles each of the 8 modes with specific workflows
3. **AI Agent Persona Selection** - Existing agent selection (for Full Development Mode)
4. **Enhanced Commands** - Expanded command system with new capabilities

### 2. New Task Definitions (web-build-sample/tasks.txt)

**Added 6 New Workflow Tasks:**

1. **`documentation-mode-workflow`** - Mode 1: Collaborative AI agent intelligence for 3-document handoff
2. **`continue-existing-project-workflow`** - Mode 3: Context restoration and intelligent continuation
3. **`task-list-overview-workflow`** - Mode 4: Comprehensive project status dashboard
4. **`debug-troubleshoot-workflow`** - Mode 5: Systematic issue diagnosis and resolution
5. **`continuous-execution-workflow`** - Mode 6: Autonomous workflow execution without interruptions
6. **`feature-gap-analysis-workflow`** - Mode 7: Comprehensive feature and improvement analysis
7. **`github-integration-workflow`** - Mode 8: Professional repository documentation and GitHub standards

### 3. Enhanced Agent Configuration (web-build-sample/agent-config.txt)

**Added 3 New AI Agents:**

1. **Task Breakdown Specialist (Tyler)** - Specializes in task management and workflow organization
2. **Technical Writer (Taylor)** - Expert in documentation and GitHub repository standards
3. **Security Engineer (Sage)** - Cybersecurity expert for vulnerability assessment and security analysis
