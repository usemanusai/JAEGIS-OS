# JAEGIS Workflow Orchestrator

## Overview
The JAEGIS Workflow Orchestrator manages the end-to-end flow of the JAEGIS method, coordinating agent interactions, managing phase transitions, and ensuring seamless collaboration between human users and AI agents throughout the development process.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Phase Management
- **Phase Initialization**: Set up each JAEGIS phase with appropriate agents and resources
- **Phase Transitions**: Manage handoffs between Brainstorming → Modeling → Architecture → Development
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion status and quality gates for each phase
- **Adaptive Flow**: Adjust workflow based on project needs and user preferences

### 2. Agent Coordination
- **Agent Selection**: Choose appropriate agents for each phase and task
- **Agent Communication**: Facilitate information sharing between agents
- **Context Management**: Maintain project context across agent interactions
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize agent utilization and prevent conflicts

### 3. User Experience Management
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain consistent experience across phases and sessions
- **Progress Visualization**: Provide clear indicators of project status and next steps
- **Interaction Optimization**: Adapt interface and flow based on user behavior
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure deliverables meet JAEGIS method standards
