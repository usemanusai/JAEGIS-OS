I need you to enhance the existing JAEGIS AI Agent Orchestrator system by expanding the mandatory Mode Selection Menu from 2 options to 8 comprehensive options. Currently, users must choose between "Documentation Mode" and "Full Development Mode" before proceeding.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Maintain the existing mandatory selection requirement - users MUST select a mode before any other actions
- All new modes must integrate seamlessly with the existing AI agent orchestration system defined in `agent-config.txt`
- Preserve the collaborative intelligence approach with specialist AI agents (Product Manager AI John, Architect AI Fred, Security Engineer AI Sage, etc.)
- Each mode should have clear purpose, scope, expected outcomes, and specific AI agent activation patterns
- Update the core operational workflow in the system instructions to handle all 8 modes

**NEW MODE DEFINITIONS:**

**Option 3: Continue Existing Project Mode**
- **Purpose**: Resume work on projects interrupted by token limits, session boundaries, or context loss
- **Functionality**: 
  - Automatically scan current workspace using `view` tool for project artifacts (prd.md, architecture.md, checklist.md, task lists, code files, package.json, etc.)
  - Parse and analyze existing documentation to understand project context, technology stack, and current implementation state
  - Use `view_tasklist` to identify incomplete Phases, Epics, and Stories from existing task hierarchies
  - Generate a "Project Resume Summary" showing completed vs. remaining work with percentage completion and critical path analysis
  - Present user with selectable continuation points at specific phase/epic/story levels with context-aware recommendations
  - Reactivate appropriate specialist AI agents based on the selected continuation point and project type
  - Maintain full context continuity from previous session state using existing task management tools
- **AI Agent Activation**: Context-dependent based on continuation point (PM for planning phases, Architect for technical phases, etc.)

**Option 4: Task List Overview Mode**
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive project status dashboard and interactive task management for existing projects
- **Functionality**:
  - Use `view_tasklist` and workspace analysis to parse all task management files and generate hierarchical task visualization
  - Display task structure: Phases ‚Üí Epics ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Subtasks with completion percentages and dependency mapping
  - Show task dependencies, blockers, critical path analysis, and resource allocation
  - Provide effort estimation and complexity scoring for remaining work using AI agent expertise
  - Generate priority-ranked task recommendations with risk assessment
  - Allow drill-down selection into specific task branches for focused work sessions
  - Export task status reports in multiple formats (markdown, JSON, Mermaid diagrams)
  - Support task reorganization and priority adjustment through `update_tasks` and `reorganize_tasklist`
- **AI Agent Activation**: Task Breakdown Specialist AI (Tyler) as primary, with other agents for domain-specific analysis

**Option 5: Debug & Troubleshoot Mode**
- **Purpose**: Diagnose and resolve issues in existing projects through systematic analysis and specialist AI collaboration
- **Functionality**:
  - Run comprehensive project health diagnostics using `diagnostics` tool and workspace analysis
  - Analyze error logs, build failures, runtime issues, and dependency conflicts
  - Perform security vulnerability scanning and dependency audits
  - Use `launch-process` to run tests, linting, and automated analysis tools
  - Generate detailed issue reports with severity classification and impact assessment
  - Activate Security Engineer AI (Sage) and other relevant specialist agents for issue resolution
  - Provide step-by-step remediation plans with validation checkpoints and rollback strategies
  - Support interactive debugging sessions with real-time problem solving and collaborative AI input
- **AI Agent Activation**: Security Engineer AI (Sage) as primary, with Architect AI (Fred) and relevant specialists based on issue type

**Option 6: Continuous Execution Mode**
- **Purpose**: Execute complete workflow phases autonomously without interruption, implementing true autonomous progression
- **Functionality**:
  - **AUTONOMOUS PROGRESSION**: Automatically advance through all defined phases in sequence without user confirmation
  - **PROHIBITED INTERRUPTIONS**: Eliminate ALL permission-seeking prompts including:
    - "Would you like me to proceed/continue?"
    - "Should I move on to [next phase]?"
    - "Are you ready for [phase name]?"
    - "Can I start working on [task]?"
    - Any variation of approval requests between phases, tasks, or agent transitions
  - **STATUS COMMUNICATION**: Provide brief progress updates using format: "Phase [X]: [Action Description]..." without requesting permission
  - **STOPPING CONDITIONS**: Only halt for critical errors, missing essential information that cannot be inferred, workflow completion, or genuine blocking dependencies requiring specific user input
  - **EXECUTION PRIORITY**: Continue until natural completion or legitimate blocking issues requiring specific user input
  - **AGENT COORDINATION**: Seamlessly transition between AI agents without confirmation prompts
- **AI Agent Activation**: All relevant agents based on workflow requirements, with automatic transitions

**Option 7: Feature Gap Analysis Mode**
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of missing features, capabilities, and optimization opportunities with actionable improvement roadmap
- **Functionality**:
  - Analyze existing project against industry standards, best practices, and competitive solutions
  - Identify missing features, security gaps, performance bottlenecks, scalability issues, and technical debt
  - Compare current implementation against similar successful projects and market leaders
  - Generate feature enhancement roadmap with priority scoring, effort estimates, and business impact analysis
  - Assess technical debt and refactoring opportunities with cost-benefit analysis
  - Provide competitive analysis and market positioning recommendations
  - Create comprehensive improvement backlog with effort estimates and implementation strategies
  - Generate actionable recommendations with specific implementation approaches
- **AI Agent Activation**: Product Manager AI (John) for feature analysis, Architect AI (Fred) for technical assessment, Security Engineer AI (Sage) for security gaps

**Option 8: GitHub Integration & Documentation Mode**
- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive GitHub repository documentation, manage pull requests, and implement professional repository standards
- **Functionality**:
  - **Repository Analysis**: Scan current workspace to understand project structure, technology stack, and existing documentation
  - **README Generation**: Create comprehensive, professional README.md following GitHub best practices with:
    - Project header with badges, description, and table of contents
    - Architecture overview with professional Mermaid diagrams using `flowchart TB` format and `classDef` styling
    - Installation instructions, usage examples, API documentation, and configuration details
    - Contributing guidelines, license information, changelog, and support contacts
  - **GitHub Workflow Management**: 
    - Create feature branches with conventional naming (feature/comprehensive-readme-documentation)
    - Use conventional commit format (feat: add comprehensive README with architecture diagrams)
    - Generate pull request templates with detailed descriptions and checklists
    - Implement proper merge strategies and post-merge cleanup
  - **Documentation Standards**: Ensure GitHub Flavored Markdown compliance, validate Mermaid diagrams, test all links
  - **Visual Design**: Apply consistent spacing, syntax highlighting, emoji usage, and professional formatting
