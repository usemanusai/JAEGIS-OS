/**
 * Task Orchestration Integration Module
 *
 * Provides comprehensive task orchestration capabilities including automated
 * decomposition, multi-agent coordination, and background optimization for the
 * JAEGIS Chunky system. Handles the complete task orchestration pipeline from
 * complexity assessment to execution completion with professional coordination
 * and optimization standards.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Automated task complexity assessment and decomposition triggering
 * - Comprehensive multi-agent coordination and execution orchestration
 * - Intelligent background optimization and performance enhancement
 * - Real-time monitoring and adaptive execution management
 * - Professional resource allocation and workload balancing
 *
 * Integration Capabilities:
 * - Context7 automatic research for task management methodologies and optimization techniques
 * - Cross-platform task orchestration and execution coordination
 * - Real-time performance monitoring and optimization tracking
 * - Automated quality assurance and validation throughout execution
 * - Professional background operation with minimal user interruption
