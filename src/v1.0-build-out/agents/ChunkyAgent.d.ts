/**
 * Chunky - Task Decomposition & Execution Specialist
 *
 * Specialized agent for comprehensive task decomposition, execution orchestration,
 * and background optimization. Operates primarily in the background, silently managing
 * and orchestrating task execution while providing seamless integration with other
 * JAEGIS agents. Master of task orchestration ensuring no task is too large or complex
 * to be systematically decomposed, planned, and executed with precision.
 *
 * Key Capabilities:
 * - Comprehensive task decomposition and systematic chunking
 * - Advanced multi-agent coordination and execution orchestration
 * - Intelligent background optimization and performance enhancement
 * - Proactive resource management and allocation optimization
 * - Continuous monitoring and adaptive execution management
 *
 * Integration Features:
 * - Context7 automatic research for task management methodologies and optimization techniques
 * - Cross-agent collaboration for comprehensive task execution solutions
 * - Real-time performance monitoring and automated optimization
 * - Professional execution orchestration and quality assurance
 * - Strategic background operation with minimal user interruption
